## Release Notes

7/8/16  This project is a work-in-progress, with enough features to be minimally useful.

## Status

This application displays a rotating sequence of randomly-selected images, kind of like a screensaver.

## User Guide

### Deployment

1. Put BrowserHome.js and index.html into the directory of your choice.
2. Put your images into that directory.
3. Make sure that your images have the format required by BrowserHome.js. By the default, the files are expected to be named something like DesktopPhotos.0042.jpeg.
4. Modify BrowserHome.js and index.html as needed to suit your deployment. Probably you'll need at least to change the IMAGE_COUNT variable. 

### Use 

* Point your browser at index.html and enjoy the pictures
* (Optional) Configure your browser to make index.html its homepage

## TODO 

* Describe the motivations for this project
* Improve the user documentation
* Add more features like note taking, music player control, etc.
* Integrate with MShell. Eventually this project can become a GUI for MShell.
